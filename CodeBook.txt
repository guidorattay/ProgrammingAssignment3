This file describes the variables in both dataframes.

df: This dataframe shows the mean and the standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the X, Y and Z axis
	for each measurement of each activity of each subject.

	Column 1 -Subject: 30 subjects were evaluated
	Column 2 -Activity: The acceleration data were collected for 6 different activities, including
	"standing","sitting","laying","walking", "walking_downstairs", and "walking_upstairs"

	Columns 3 to 8:
		3."TotalBodyAcc-mean-X": mean of the Total Body Acceleration for the X axis
		4."TotalBodyAcc-mean-Y": mean of the Total Body Acceleration for the Y axis
		5."TotalBodyAcc-mean-Z": mean of the Total Body Acceleration for the Z axis
		6."TotalBodyAcc-std-X": standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the X axis
		7."TotalBodyAcc-std-Y": standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the Y axis
		8."TotalBodyAcc-std-Z": standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the Z axis

tidy_df: This dataframe shows the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

	Column 1 -Subject: 30 subjects were evaluated
	Column 2 -Activity: The acceleration data were collected for 6 different activities, including
	"standing","sitting","laying","walking", "walking_downstairs", and "walking_upstairs"

	Columns 3 to 8:
		3."TotalBodyAcc-mean-X": mean of the mean Total Body Acceleration for the X axis for a each activity of a given subject.
		4."TotalBodyAcc-mean-Y": mean of the of the Total Body Acceleration for the Y axis for a each activity of a given subject.
		5."TotalBodyAcc-mean-Z": mean of the mean of the Total Body Acceleration for the Z axis for a each activity of a given subject.
		6."TotalBodyAcc-std-X": mean of the standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the X axis for a each activity of a given subject.
		7."TotalBodyAcc-std-Y": mean of the standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the Y axis for a each activity of a given subject.
		8."TotalBodyAcc-std-Z": mean of the standard deviation of the Total Body Acceleration for the Z axis for a each activity of a given subject.
